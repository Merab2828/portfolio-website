            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Portfolio Website Development</h3> 
            <p>We successfully designed and developed our individual portfolio websites. This project involved creating a personalized online space to showcase our skills, projects, and experiences. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we tailored the websites to reflect our unique identities and professional aspirations. Through this joint effort, we not only honed our web development skills but also gained valuable insights into creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. The portfolio websites stand as a testament to our commitment to presenting ourselves effectively in the digital realm.</p>
           <h3>Employee Management System</h3> 
            <p>
                We successfully developed an Employee Management System. Leveraging object-oriented principles, we created classes for employees, salaries, and deductions. The system facilitates new employee additions, accurate salary calculations, and the generation of detailed payroll reports. This project not only enhanced my coding skills but also provided valuable experience in collaborative development and the practical application of object-oriented programming concepts. The Employee Management System showcases my commitment to creating efficient and organized software solutions.
